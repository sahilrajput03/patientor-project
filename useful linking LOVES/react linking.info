:: 1$ THIS IS HELPFUL TO MAKE EDITORS ESLINT TO WORK.(RESTART AFTERWARDS)
2$ and 3$ are dependencies required by create-react-app.
:: You should close VSCODE and start vscode completely to be able to work editors eslint to work actually.
:: So, whole space is only occupied by the cache produces by react or babel or webpack's cache in node_modules/.cache folder. Its around 10 mb in total though, generated when we start the appp with npm start(react-scripts start)
:: IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU NEED typescript to be linked locally(from global node_modules), as apps created with create-react-app requires it to run the app. That is bcoz, React says it isn't installed.
